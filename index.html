            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, and welcome to my website. I’m a 23-year-old software engineering student at Polytechnique Montréal with a strong passion for technology and creativity. My journey in software development is driven by curiosity and a love for problem-solving, whether it's building a new project or diving deep into the world of algorithms.</p>
            <p>Beyond my academic life, I have a wide range of interests that keep me inspired. I’m an avid gamer who enjoys exploring different virtual worlds, always seeking out new challenges. Music is another big part of my life—I play both the guitar and ukulele, finding joy in creating melodies and experimenting with new sounds.</p>
            <p>Art is also one of my passions, and I spend time drawing as a way to express my ideas visually. Whether it's sketching something new or improving my digital art skills, I love the creative process. Most importantly, I value the time I spend with friends, sharing experiences and making memories.</p>
            <p>I’m constantly eager to learn, grow, and take on new challenges, both in the tech world and in my personal life.</p>
